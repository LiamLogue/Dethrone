# Dethrone
Final year project. A game made in Unity3D (4.5.5F1) where you control a character using right clicks, cast spells using QWER and use items by pressing 12345 (depending on which item you want to use).

I had zero previous experience in Unity before starting this project. There may be bugs or silly ways of doing certain tasks, but it's my first Unity game.

Requires Unity3D 4.5.5F1 to run.
